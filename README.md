# Java-Spring-Boot-Projects ðŸ’»

I did these projects while learning the Spring Boot Java framework.

What I Learned:

Maven,

Spring Boot,

Spring Rest,

Spring Data JPA,

MySQL Driver,

Spring Web, and

Spring Boot DevTools


In Eclipse, run these projects as a Spring Boot App and in your browser; go to http://localhost:8080/.
